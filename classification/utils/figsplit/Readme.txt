Using FigSplit
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This code is created for helping users use FigSplit automatically.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

To run this code, you can put all images in the input folder. For each image,
its panels with their coordinates will be found in the output folder as a
zip file. 


Input_path: The path of the folder containing all images that you want to split

Output_path: The path of the folder that will contain all downloaded zip files 
             resulted from FigSplit

You can also change the input path and the output path for
your usage.

All exceptions are recorded in the log file under the input path.
